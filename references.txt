(this link took me FOREVER to find, although it succinctly brought all the previous links together. Blame the lack of linked
documentation, I guess.)

General resources:
The MozillaZine extension development forum (http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewforum.php?f=19) is an active Thunderbird
development community and is a good place to get advice from devs more familiar with the Mozilla ecosystem.

Once the next version of Thunderbird goes live, this add-on will need to be converted to be compatible with
the MailExtensions format. This shouldn't be too hard (fingers crossed), but it'll require some reworking 
of the install.rdf and similar files. This extension is written in Overlay format, so it'll need to be declared through
legacy as such.
